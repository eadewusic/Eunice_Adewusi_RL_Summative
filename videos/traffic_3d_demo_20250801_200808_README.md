## What You'll See in the Video

### Visual Elements
1. **3D Traffic Junction**: Realistic intersection with roads, buildings, and traffic lights
2. **Dynamic Vehicles**: Colored vehicles representing traffic queues from each direction
3. **Traffic Light System**: Real-time traffic light changes based on agent decisions
4. **Performance HUD**: Live metrics including:
   - Current episode and step
   - Real-time reward tracking
   - Current action being taken
   - Traffic light state and timer
   - Queue lengths for each direction
   - Total vehicles waiting and processed

### Episode Structure
The video shows **3 complete episodes** of the RL agent controlling traffic:

- **Episode 1**: -133.00 reward - Agent learning traffic patterns
- **Episode 2**: -144.00 reward - Adaptation to different traffic scenarios  
- **Episode 3**: -179.00 reward - Final performance demonstration

## How the Agent Works

### Reward System
The agent receives rewards/penalties based on:
- **Positive**: Keeping traffic flowing smoothly, appropriate light timing
- **Negative**: Long queues, unnecessary light switches, gridlock conditions

### State Information
The agent observes:
- Vehicle queue lengths in all directions
- Current traffic light state and remaining time
- Time of day (affects traffic patterns)
- Emergency vehicle presence
- Historical traffic flow metrics

### Decision Making
Each step, the agent:
1. Observes current traffic state
2. Selects optimal action using trained policy
3. Receives reward based on traffic flow improvement
4. Updates traffic light system accordingly

## Rwanda Context
This simulation represents traffic management challenges in Kigali, Rwanda:
- **Rush Hour Patterns**: Morning (7-9 AM) and evening (5-7 PM) traffic surges
- **Vehicle Mix**: Cars, buses (important public transport), motorcycles (very popular)
- **Emergency Priority**: Ambulances and emergency vehicles get immediate priority
- **Real-world Constraints**: Minimum light timing, pedestrian considerations

## Performance Interpretation

### Reward Scale Understanding
- **Above -100**: Excellent traffic management, minimal delays
- **-100 to -150**: Very good performance, occasional minor delays
- **-150 to -200**: Good performance, manageable traffic flow
- **-200 to -250**: Fair performance, some congestion issues
- **Below -250**: Needs improvement, significant delays

### Agent Performance: **GOOD**
Average reward of **-152.00** indicates solid traffic management with manageable congestion levels.
