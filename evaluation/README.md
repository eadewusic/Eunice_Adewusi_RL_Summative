### **Training Analysis Success:**
- **Best Training Curves** - 4 best configurations per algorithm family
- **All Configuration Curves** - Complete 17-configuration learning curves
- **Training Stability Analysis** - Variance, convergence, efficiency metrics
- **Objective Function Curves** - DQN Q-values + Policy gradient analysis

## **Key Insights**

### **Algorithm Performance Ranking:**
1. **PPO_AGGRESSIVE**: -151.85 (+74.7% improvement) - **Elite Tier**
2. **PPO Family Dominance**: All 4 PPO configs successful (73.6% to 74.7%)
3. **REINFORCE**: 3/4 configs successful (59.5% to 68.5%)
4. **Actor-Critic**: Mixed results (catastrophic failures + some success)
5. **DQN**: All configs below random baseline (-29.8% to -1119.2%)

### **Training Data Quality:**
- **DQN**: Extensive training (25,000 episodes each) but poor results
- **REINFORCE**: Substantial training (750-1000 episodes) with good results  
- **PPO**: Efficient training (13-49 episodes) with excellent results
- **Actor-Critic**: Missing training logs (explains mixed performance)

## **Key Takeaway:**
**PPO emerges as the clear winner** - not only does it achieve the best performance, but it does so with remarkable efficiency (requiring far fewer training episodes than DQN) and exceptional consistency across all hyperparameter configurations.
